&nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you're looking for a super simple, comforting, no-frills bowl of spaghetti and meatballs, you've come to the right place.<br/>
and if you're feeling adventurous, it's also a great jumping off point for your own version of this classic dish!<br><br/>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen it comes to sauce, you've got options.<br/>For an even speedier dinner, you can totally go with jarred marinara sauce. Or, if you've got some time on your hands, we love this simple Marcella Hazan-inspired spaghetti sauce. Feel free to try your own favorite herbs and spices, tasting as you go!<br><br/>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe same goes for meatballs. We've got tons of recipes, from cheesy Tex-Mex Meatballs to spicy Harissa Meatballs; don't be afraid to experiment with your mix-ins, there are so many delicious meatball flavor combos just waiting for you to discover them. However you flavor them, make sure not to crowd the pan while frying. If needed, fry in batches, so that each meatball gets a chance to form a delicious golden crust.<br><br/>
